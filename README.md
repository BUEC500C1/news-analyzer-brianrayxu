News Analyzer API suite using Flask, Google NLP, and ...


## Module Outlines

### I. File Uploader
#### Design
As a user of this API, I would want to be able to:
1. Upload a file successfully into some file storage on the cloud.
2. Have this file be documented in a database for easy access later on.
3. See some confirmation on whether my file was successfully uploaded or not.

This module will be both procedure and entity based. The actual file uploading task will be designed to be procedural based due to the different types of user input. The flexibility offered by a task-by-task API will allow different upload types (jpg, pdf, docx) to have their own individual process flows.
